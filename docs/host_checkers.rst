Host checkers
=============

.. include:: includes/all.rst

Before the decryption key gets passed to the remote host, it must be ensured
that the remote host is the authentic one and that it is in a trustworthy state.

Currently, the strongest sign that this is the case is the host key verification
done by SSH which ensures that the remote host has access to itâ€™s private host
key.

Additional to that, a few checkers are implemented which hook in at various
stages of fdeunlock execution.


Network based checkers
----------------------

``LinkLayerAddressChecker``
  Checks the network link layer address as observed by the machine running fdeunlock.
  A link layer address is only expected to be available if the remote machine
  and the machine fdeunlock is running on communicate over the same link layer network.

  This check might be interesting because the link layer address is not stored
  on disk (at least not in clear text). An adversary having only access to the
  disks would have no easy way to get to know this address.

  Note that the link layer address is typically capturable and spoofable in a
  local network.


SSH based checkers
------------------

.. _fdeunlock__ref_ChecksumChecker:

``ChecksumChecker``
  Compute checksums for all files in the initramfs and compare the checksums to
  previously measured trusted once.

  Note that if an reasonably funded adversary is in the position to tamper with
  your initramfs this check will probably not be able to catch them.
  All this check tries to do is to increase the cost of such an attach or even catch less
  skilled attackers.

  There are many ways how this check can be fooled. For example, the check does
  not checksum the loaded/running kernel image nor the boot loader nor the system
  firmware.

  The ``additional_checksum_commands`` configuration option can be used to
  specify additional commands for checksumming/verification. The output of
  those commands is included in the checksum file and comparison with the
  previous measurement.
  Multiple commands can be given, separated by newline.
  Example:

  .. code-block:: ini

     [DEFAULT]
     additional_checksum_commands =
       uname -a
       dmesg | egrep '(DMI:|Command line:|Booting paravirtualized kernel on bare hardware)' | sed 's/^\[\s*[[:digit:].]\+\]\s*//;'
       cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_serial /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_uuid
       ls /dev/disk/by-id/
       grep '^MemTotal:' /proc/meminfo
       dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 | sha512sum -

  The ``diff_command`` configuration option can be used to set a different text
  diffing program than the default `diff`.
  Comparison is run on your local machine so note that the diffing program is
  exposed to untrusted input.
  Example:

  .. code-block:: ini

     [DEFAULT]
     diff_command = git diff --color-words --no-index

  Proper remote attestation (Trusted Computing) should be implemented.
  Feel free to add supported for this to FDEunlock :-)

``AuthenticatedLatencyChecker``
  Measure the latency over SSH and check if it is within expected boundaries.

  The default boundaries are 0.01 s (10 ms) and can be configured using the
  ``authenticated_latency_deviation`` configuration option.

  The intention of this check is to detect a variant of an evil maid attack where
  the host you think you are just unlocking is not the one you are actually
  unlocking.
  Such an attack might have different latency characteristics because even the
  most advanced adversary is still bound by the law of physics like the speed
  of light.
